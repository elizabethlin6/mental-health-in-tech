  <b><h2>My motivations:</h2></b>
  Closing on my freshman year, I think the greatest obstacle me was
  not just overcoming imposter syndrome, but recognizing mental health problems that
  arose throughout the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every quarter was different, sometimes you had a comfortable
  group of friends and supporters to rely on. But sometimes you were thrown
  into independence, working alone on countless weekdays, rarely meeting up with friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amidst the isolated island that my mind was floating upon, I questioned the
  effectiveness of independent work.
  <br>
  <br>
  It benefitted my concentration and kept me from
  getting distracted, yet mentally I felt incompetent and isolated from others
  constantly...
  <br>
  <br>
  and worse of all I didn't realize how much this was affecting my
  interactions with others.


  <div class = "paragraph-2">
    <b><h2>My Questions:</h2></b>

    <ul>
      <i><li>How often did mental health issues occur in tech workers who were female or male?</i><br><br>
      <i><li>Does working at home or at a company increase the chances of workers getting affected by mental health?</i><br><br>
      <i><li>How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location?</i><br><br>
      <i><li>What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?</i><br><br>
    </ul>

  <div class = "paragraph-3">
    <b><h2>My Approach:</h2></b>

    When I see a problem, I break it down to the root. I wanted to investigate the trends of mental health
    issues in the Tech Industry and correlate to the its transcendenting push on college students, who
    likely struggle with these issues in their college careers.<br><br>

      <ol>
        <li>The problem that I wanted to solve required obtaining primary-source data, so my first step was to
        grab a credible dataset from Kaggle called "<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/version/2">Mental Health in Tech Survey</a>."

        <li>I examined the componenets of the dataset I would use, factoring into <strong>what</strong> questions I wanted to answer
        and <strong>how</strong> I would answer them.
      </ol>
