Acquiring the data from kaggle.com, "Mental Health in Tech Survey".
My motivations: Closing on my freshman year, I think the greatest obstacle me was
not just overcoming imposter syndrome, but recognizing mental health problems that
arose throughout the year. Every quarter was different, sometimes you had a comfortable
group of friends and supporters to rely on. But the next quarter you were thrown
into independence, working alone on countless weekdays, rarely meeting up with close
ones. Amidst the isolated island that my mind was floating upon, I questioned the
effectiveness of independent work. It benefitted my concentration and kept me from
getting distracted, yet mentally I felt incompetent and isolated from others
constantly - and worse of all I didn't realize how much this was affecting my
interactions with others.

We are interested in gauging how mental health is viewed within the tech/IT workplace,
and the prevalence of certain mental health disorders within the tech industry.
The Open Sourcing Mental Illness team of volunteers will use this data to drive
our work in raising awareness and improving conditions for those with mental
health disorders in the IT workplace.
